# Contributing to Genesis Engine

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Genesis Engine.
Genesis is an open-source project built around clarity, systems-driven design,
and creator freedom. Contributions are welcome and appreciated.

This document describes how to contribute without breaking the project’s vision
or technical foundations.

---

## Guiding Principles

Before contributing, please keep these principles in mind:

- Prefer clarity over cleverness
- Favor simple, explicit designs
- Avoid premature optimization
- Respect the existing architecture
- Small, focused changes are better than large rewrites

Genesis values **understandable code** more than short-term performance gains.

---

## Ways to Contribute

You can contribute in many ways:

- Reporting bugs
- Improving documentation
- Writing examples or tutorials
- Fixing issues
- Proposing new systems or improvements
- Reviewing pull requests

Code contributions are welcome, but non-code contributions are equally valuable.

---

## Before Writing Code

Please do the following before submitting a pull request:

1. Check existing issues and pull requests
2. Open an issue if your change is non-trivial
3. Describe **what** you want to change and **why**
4. Wait for feedback before implementing large features

This helps avoid duplicated work and misaligned contributions.

---

## Code Style and Expectations

- Follow Rust best practices
- Keep functions small and focused
- Avoid unnecessary abstractions
- Write comments when intent is not obvious
- Prefer explicit names over short ones

If your code is difficult to understand, it will likely be rejected or revised.

---

## Pull Request Guidelines

When submitting a pull request:

- Keep the scope small and focused
- Explain the motivation behind the change
- Reference related issues when applicable
- Ensure the project builds successfully
- Update documentation if behavior changes

Pull requests may be revised or declined if they do not align with Genesis’ goals.
This is not a judgment of quality, but of fit.

---

## Architectural Changes

Changes that affect core architecture (ECS, rendering abstraction, scene system)
require discussion and approval before implementation.

Genesis evolves deliberately and carefully.

---

## Licensing

By contributing to Genesis Engine, you agree that your contributions
will be licensed under the MIT License, consistent with the rest of the project.

---

## Final Note

Genesis is a collaborative effort.
Be patient, be respectful, and be open to feedback.

Thank you for helping build something meaningful.
